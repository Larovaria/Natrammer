- It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.     - How'd you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.     I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can't get by that face.     So who is she?     She's... human.     No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.     - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She's so
nice. And she's a florist!     Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!     We're not dating.     You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!     And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
