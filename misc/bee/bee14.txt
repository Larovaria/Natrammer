Pinhead.     - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.     The Thomas 3000!     Smoker?     Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.     A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.     They make the honey, and we make the money.     &quot;They make the honey, and we make the money&quot;?     Oh, my!     What's going on? Are you OK?     Yeah. It doesn't last too long.     Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?     Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.     This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!     That's a drag queen!     What is this?     Oh, no!     There's hundreds of them!     Bee honey.     Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!

They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!     Even if it's true, what can one bee do?     Sting them where it really hurts.     In the face! The eye!     - That would hurt. - No.     Up the nose? That's a killer.     There's only one
