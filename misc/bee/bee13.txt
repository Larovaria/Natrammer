These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they're on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You're not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I'm going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.     But don't kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey
jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!     I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.     I mean, that honey's ours.     - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.     It's a close community.     Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.     - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.     Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!     At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.     Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.     Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.     You got to be kidding me!     Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!     - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!     I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?     We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.     What is this place?     A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.     They are pinheads!
