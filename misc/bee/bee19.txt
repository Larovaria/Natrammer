just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.     I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.     Oh, that was lucky.     There's a little left. I could heat it up.     Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.     So I hear you're quite a tennis player.     I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.     That's where I usually sit. Right... there.     Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,     and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.     You think I don't see what you're doing?     I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.     Do we?     Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.     That's just what I was thinking about doing.     Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.     I'm going to drain the old stinger.     Yeah, you do that.     Look at that.     You
know, I've just about had it     with your little mind games.     - What's that? - Italian Vogue.     Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.     A lot of ads.     Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?     Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!     I think something stinks in here!     I love the smell of flowers.     How do you like the smell of flames?!     Not as much.     Water bug! Not taking sides!     Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!     I've got issues!     Well, well, well, a royal flush!     - You're bluffing. - Am I?     Surf's up, dude!     Poo water!     That bowl is gnarly.     Except for those dirty yellow rings!     Kenneth! What are you doing?!     You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!     We need to talk!     He's just a little bee!     And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!     Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in
