destruction!     You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!     Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!     - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.     What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison     from my heaving buttocks?     I will have order in this court. Order!     Order, please!     The case of the honeybees versus the human race     took a pointed turn against the bees     yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.     - Hey, buddy. - Hey.     - Is there much pain? - Yeah.     I...     I blew the whole case, didn't I?     It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.     I'd be better off dead. Look at me.     They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.     Look, there's a little celery still on it.     What was it like to sting someone?     I can't explain it. It was all...     All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!     All right.     You think it was all a trap?     Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.     What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.     What will the humans do to us if they win?     I don't know.     I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.     Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!     Oh, my.     Oould you get a nurse to close that window?     - Why? - The smoke.     Bees don't smoke.     Right. Bees don't smoke.     Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.     That's it! That's our case!     It is? It's not over?     Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.     Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.     And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman.     Yes? Yes, Your Honor!     Where is the rest of your team?     Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.     Bees are trained to fly
