 To everyone asking: yes it is supposed to sound like that. Bass so loud it squashes everything else, the musical equivalent of getting hit by a high powered air fan, peeling your cap back. No worries if you don't get it or don't like it, I'm aware it's not for everyone, but my original jungle crew and bassheads will get it. And DJs will see the effect in the rave when they drop it. I feel it doesn't always need to be about the classic mixdown and making everything sound superclean, sometimes it just needs to be dirty as f***, ya feel me? Stay tuned for more music coming soon and thanks for all the support!!
