 ...you people do realize there are different meme groups for different types of memes, right? Like fuck there’s plenty of groups you could’ve shared this to where it would MAKE SENSE. It’s not that hard to decipher meme content fuuuuh. I’m in a meme group called wait a minute this is not flavortown and we share pictures of food that may or may not be flavortown. In ketamemers we share ketamemes. Not this stupid fucking 12-year-old brain HAHA VIBRATOR GO BRRR post. If it’s not going to be a meme that pertains to the PURPOSE OF THIS GROUP then at least have some couth or originality beyond middle school humor. You people are ruining this group.
